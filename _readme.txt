When designing my metadata fields, I knew that I would have to make unique categories, because a scrapbook is an unusual piece to analyze. Since there was so much variety within the book, 
I knew that my categories would have to be effective for many different types of materials. To understand the story and history of the scrapbook, I included the date of the original 
document(s) on each page if it was available. Even though the book is from 1936, each material within it was created at a different time and place. I think it is beneficial to know the 
origins of individual materials, not just the year the scrapbook was put together. I also had content type as metadata to track the variety of different items within the book. For content 
descriptions, I had a description column that allowed me to explain the images/text on each page. I also kept track of featured groups, people, and locations. While creating these 
sections, I made an effort not to imply any associations and to only write what was explicitly stated or shown. Since there were so many images with captions, I added an image caption tab 
to capture keywords and the raw, authentic words of each piece. This book had many smaller pamphlets, fliers, and brochures pasted into it, each with its own pages. So, in my miscellaneous 
tab, I noted whether there were multiple pages to the document. For these pieces, I only analyzed the first page because the inner pages are part of their own document. I wanted to examine 
what appeared directly on the scrapbook pages, as that is the piece I’m modeling. In my miscellaneous tab, I also included notes on how materials were pasted to the pages because I noticed 
some variation and wanted to provide more details about the piece’s physical condition. Additionally, I had a physical condition column, where I noted the wear of each page’s materials. 
Finally, I had a language tab where I recorded the languages on each page, because there were some variations and pages with multiple languages.
