THE LAST FEW YEARS
HAVE BROUGHT GREAT CHANGES

-but the greatest and still the newest improvement is this: the V-8 engine has stepped down from "wealthy" cars to the low price field. Have you got one in your car?
The comfort of expensive cars also has been brought to the low price field through redistributing car weight as well as the weight of the passengers. Ford calls it the Center-Poise Ride. Have you got it in your car?

Safety Glass has become regular Ford equipment in all doors and windows as well as in windshields-at no extra cost. Several states have passed laws requiring it.
Does your car give your family this all-round protection?

Super-Safety mechanical brakes on the Ford V-8 are the same type used on the most expensive cars. They are dependable in any emergency. Does your car have them?

Six-inch air balloon tires for easier riding and greater safety are regular Ford equipment at no extra charge. Is your car equipped with them?

Ford has developed the V-8 cylinder engine so that it uses no more gasoline than a "four" of equal power, and needs oil changes only at 2,000-mile intervals.

If you will take time to compare the way this 8-cylinder engine runs-if you will get behind the wheel and get the feel of the Ford V-8-we believe you will agree that modern motoring requires at least eight cylinders.

Not until you ride in it will you realize what a big, roomy car the Ford V-8 has become. And when it comes to driv-ing, you will have another pleasant surprise. The engine is so responsive, steering so easy, gear-shifting so effortless that driving is now more of a pleasure than ever before.

So the best plan is to take a ride. Get acquainted with the modern developments which, taken all together, make to-
day's Ford V-8 the greatest value ever offered by the Ford
Motor Company. We have a car ready for you to take the family driving in. Phone us.
